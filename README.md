# SNHU-School-Projects
This Repository includes projects from SNHU in Java, Python, and C++. It also includes Supplemenetary web apps and smaller  assignments focused on showing proficiency in a single element from the given language.

## Description of Projects

### Airgead Project Two
This C++ project required me to create a banking application for a fictional client named Airgead. The required features include allowing the user to input inital deposits, monthly deposits, interest rate, and time in years and then allowing the user to see interest on the initial investement or compounded with the monthly deposits.

### C++ File Manipulation
In this small assignment I was tasked with reading data from a text file, formatting the data and writing it back in to a new text file. The application was written in C++.

### Dicee Challenge*
In this project I was tasked with using JavaScript to show profficiency in DOM manipulation. Features of the application include two random dice that represent the player and the computer, with each dice being "thrown" each time the page refreshes. An attached image would also be updated according to the number that was randomly chosen. 

### Drum Kit*
This project required me to build a Drum Kit that would play audio when an event that the user would trigger with a mouseclick or the assigned keystroke happened. This was created to show proficiency in event listeners in JavaScript.

### Module 6 Assignment
This C++ assignment required me to build a lightweight application that displays a multiplication table of a number that the user would input. It also allowed the user to double the number if they wish.

### Project One Clocks
I was tasked with creating a C++ application that would receive the local time and display it in two formats to the user. The program would get the time the moment the application ran and allowed the user to modify the clocks by adding or removing hours, minutes, or seconds.

### Project Three
This Project was assigned to show how Python should be integrated into C++ and how using two languages can lead to a more efficient program. The program had to receive input in C++, have Python use the data in some way, return it back to C++, and display it to the user in C++ as well.

### Simple Calculator
C++ assignment that required me to create a calculator that could perform the four basic operations from two numbers.

### Gameauth
This Java project tasked me with using design patterns (singleton pattern, iterator pattern) to create a REST API for a web-based game application from a fictional client. The application had to create the development environment as well as handle security and resource allocation for the rest of the application.

### Module2
This Java project tasked me with using object-oriented programming to create classes for the same fictional client from the Gameauth project. I also had to use the singleton design pattern to avoid multiple instances of a class from running at the same time.
